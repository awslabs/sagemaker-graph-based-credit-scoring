    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Credit ratings are traditionally generated using models that use financial statement data and market data, which is typically in tabular form, i.e., numeric and categorical data. This model constructs a network of firms using text from SEC filings and shows that using the network of firm relationships with tabular data can generate more accurate rating predictions. The model demonstrates a methodology to use big data to extend tabular data credit scoring models, which have been used by the ratings industry for decades, to the class of machine learning models on networks."

    "- *Network data*: The solution shows how to construct a network of connected companies using the MD&A section from SEC 10-K/Q filings. We assume that companies with similar forward looking statements are likely to be connected for credit events, though this is but one approach to constructing a corporate graph. These connections are represented in a graph. The solution provides a single function that generates the network. \n",

    "## Part 1: Constructing a Corporate Network using SEC Filings (`CorpNet`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple approach is used to construct a network of credit connected companies using the text in the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) section of the 10-K/Q filings, which are annual/quarterly reports companies are required to file with the SEC. The MD&A section usually contains the forward looking outlook for a company and also discusses trends and market conditions that may impact a firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To obtain the filings for each company that populates the `CorpNet`, use the AWS SageMaker JumpStart card titled \"Financial TabText Data Construction\". A blog showing how to do this is also available: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/create-a-dashboard-with-sec-text-for-financial-nlp-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/. This data has already been collected and provided in the file `text_data.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The graph is based on the distribution of cosine similarities between document embeddings of the MD\\&A section of firms' 10-K/Q filings. The similarity of two firms is given by the following equation: $s = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\cdot \\|B\\|}$, where $A, B$ are document embeddings. Since these embedding vectors may contain negative values, it is possible to return negative values. However, links in the network are based on values where $s>0.5$. The distribution of pairwise cosine similarities is shown below and the cutoff used is deep in the right tail. However, this is without loss of generality, and other cutoffs may be used to modulate the number of links in the network. \n",

    "## Part 2: The synthetic dataset of credit scoring features\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used is a well-known bankruptcy prediction approach, from the seminal paper by Altman (1968). A brief summary is provided here. See also the description at this [site](https://www.creditguru.com/index.php/bankruptcy-and-insolvency/altman-z-score-insolvency-predictor). Similar information is also available on many other sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses 8 inputs converted into 5 financial ratios: (i) Current assets ($CA$); (ii) Current liabilities ($CL$); (iii) Total Liabilities ($TL$); (iv) earnings before interest and taxes ($EBIT$); (v) Total Assets ($TA$); (vi) Net Sales ($NS$); (vii) Retained earnings ($RE$); and (viii) Market value of equity ($MVE$). The relationships between these 8 items are modeled as stipulated in the Altman model through the following five ratios: \n",
    "- A: EBIT / Total Assets \n",
    "- B: Net Sales / Total Assets\n",
    "- C: Mkt Value of equity / Total Liabilities\n",
    "- D: Working Capital / Total Assets\n",
    "- E: Retained Earnings / Total Assets\n",
    " \n",
    "The Z-score is then provided by the following formula, estimated using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the coefficients in the formula are published widely by Altman.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Zscore = 3.3 A + 0.99 B + 0.6 C + 1.2 D + 1.4 E\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High quality companies have high Z-scores and low quality companies have low ones. The simulated Z-scores used to construct our synthetic dataset are calibrated to broad balance-sheet, income-statement, and market data using averages for the U.S. economy from the following sources: \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Balance sheet data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=434&eid=196197)\n",
    "- [Income statement data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=434&eid=195208)\n",
    "- [Price to book](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New\\_Home\\_Page/datafile/pbvdata.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers taken from these sources are used to extract total values for US companies for the 8 inputs mentioned above. In addition, we obtain the average price-to-book ($P2B$) ratio for US companies, book equity value ($EQ$) and then generate market value of equity ($MVE$) as $P2B(EQ+RE)$. Working capital ($WC$) is as usual, $CA-CL$, the difference between current assets and current liabilities. We normalized all simulated financial data by Total Assets. This normalization does not impact the Altman ratios in any way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset of simulated companies and their financials is then enhanced with a column of ratings, where the ratings are mapped -- with some noise -- to the Z-score, such that higher Z-score firms are assigned higher quality ratings and lower Z-score firms get lower quality ratings. The dataset titled `tabular_data.csv` is also provided with this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the `CorpNet` graph is generated from real SEC filings, we compute \"quality\" scores for each MD&A section using JumpStart APIs for NLP scoring, see the JumpStart card titled \"NLP Score Dashboard for SEC Text\" and the related documentation [link](https://sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-pack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smjsindustry.nlp_scorer.html). The quality scores are a net sum of positive NLP scores (positivity, polarity, safe, sentiment, certainty) and negative NLP scores (fraud, litigious, negative, uncertainty, risk). These quality scores are used to associate higher \"quality\" nodes with higher ratings firms in the synthetic tabular dataset. This injects a connection between `CorpNet` and the synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the (MD&A) section of companies' SEC 10-K/Q filings to construct a corporate graph, `CorpNet`, already discussed above. The approach is based on the idea that companies facing similar risks will evidence similarities in their forward-looking statements in the MD&A section. Therefore, we construct a graph where each node is a company in the dataset and two companies are linked if the cosine similarity of their MD&A document embeddings is greater than 0.5. The notebook that accompanies this solution contains this generated graph data in addition to the tabular data described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we generate both, a graph using real SEC filings and associate it with the synthetic tabular data generated to match broad financial averages for US firms. \n",

    "1. For each source node, i.e., a row in the dataset, find its neighbor nodes sorted from nearest to furthest based on some distance measurement. The distance measurement in this example is computed based on the embeddings of a text column **MDNA** generated from the **Doc2Vec** method. However, you may use embeddings from any algorithm, such as BERT, or financial embeddings from a pre-trained [RoBERTa-SEC model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-pre-trained-financial-language-models-for-transfer-learning-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/). \n",

    "3. Add links, i.e., destination nodes for all nodes that are close in embedding space. \n",

    "## Part 4: Train a baseline model without graph machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to set a baseline that mimics a model that only uses the tabular data for each firm. This will enable a comparison of models that gain from enhancing the features used with graph data. In order to be agnostic to the baseline model and to set a competitive baseline, AutoGluon Tabular using a SageMaker AutoGluon Container is used to fit ML models the tabular data. AutoGluon has been shown to beat most other AutoML packages in kaggle competitions, discussed in this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/machine-learning-with-autogluon-an-open-source-automl-library/). It uses stack-ensembling over a wide range of models and exploits the tabular feature set comprehensively. In contrast, for graph ML we use the [deep graph library (DGL)](https://www.dgl.ai/) that only fits one GNN which may be optimally chosen with hyperparmater optimization and will likely only beat AutoGluon in accuracy if there is sufficient information in the graph that adds value to the classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next few blocks of code will train a rating classifier on the tabular features in this solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by uploading the train and test data to a S3 bucket."

    "## Part 5: A Brief Introduction to Graph Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have some knowledge of graph theory. The summary below is a brief description of graph ML. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Machine learning using graph data is a broad subject and good expositions are available in books by Hamilton (2020); Blumauer and Nagy (2020); Ma and Tang (2021). (References below.) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graph machine learning requires representing the information on graphs as graph embeddings, of which a particular type is node embeddings. We can use deep learning methods to construct quality node embeddings using algorithms like [node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/). You may also construct embeddings for links in a graph and also embeddings for entire graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Neural networks are used for classification with graph convolutional network (GCN) layers that use the normalized graph adjacency matrix with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to incorporate network relationships into deep graph learning (Kipf and Welling, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. A graph (or network) $G$ comprises nodes or vertexes (set $V$, of size $|V|=n$) and links or edges (set $E$, of size $|E|=m$) and hence may be written as $G(V,E)$. The edge set may be (i) directed or undirected, (ii) weighted or unweighted. The graph may have single node types and single edge types, in which case it is denoted as \"homogeneous\" graph, but if it has multiple types of nodes or links, then it is known as a \"heterogeneous\" graph. For example, in a lending network, some nodes may be borrowers, others lenders, and some both. The number of links each node has is known as the \"degree\" of the node, and the distribution of number of links across all nodes is called the \"degree distribution\" of the graph, shown earlier. Our solution here is based on nodes that are of one type, companies, and hence uses a homogeneous graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The links in a homogeneous graph are often represented by an \"adjacency matrix\" $A$ of size $n \\times n$, which represents all links in the graph with non-zero values, such that a link from node $i$ to node $j$ is designated by $A_{ij}>0$. For an undirected graph, matrix $A$ is symmetric, i.e., $A_{ij}=A_{ji}$. An alternate data structure for a graph is a links table $L$ of size $m \\times 3$, with one row for each link from node $i$ to node $j$ with edge weight $w$, which we can denote as $L(i,j,w)$. The links table is a parsimonious data structure compared to the adjacency matrix, and for large (and sparse) graphs, is much more memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Node representations (embeddings) are vectors in $d$-dimensional embedding space. Algorithms to generate these embeddings aim to map similarity of nodes in the graph to closeness in the embedding vector space. Let the $d$-dimensional embedding vectors for nodes $i,j$ be denoted as $z_i, z_j \\in {\\cal R}^d$. We try to find vectors that map into the values in the adjacency matrix $A$, i.e., minimize loss ${\\cal L} = \\sum_i \\sum_j \\parallel z_i^\\top \\cdot z_j - A_{ij} \\parallel^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. GCNs are trained to produce node, link, and graph embeddings. Node embeddings are a function of the features set of the node and its nearest neighbors, which may be a single hop away to many hops away (Cao, Lu, Xu (2015); Wu et al (2019)), a modeling choice, and have fixed length, dimension $d$. See Perozzi et al. (2014) for an efficient approach, known as `DeepWalk`, improved upon with biased random walks in the node2vec algorithm of Grover and Leskovec (2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "8. These *shallow* embeddings discussed above ignore data available on node features. They also cannot generate embeddings for new nodes that were not part of the original training of node embeddings. Better {\\it deep} encodings for nodes is possible with deep learning, using graph neural nets (GNNs). For a detailed exposition, see Scarselli et al (2009), a brief overview is as follows. Assume $k$ features at each of the $n$ nodes, resulting in a feature table $X \\in {\\cal R}^{k \\times n}$, with vector $x_i$ being the feature vector for node $i$. In our setting, these are all the variables that define the credit risk of a firm. The approach to generate embeddings is as follows. Assume a fixed neighborhood of a node (say 3 hops) and look at the 3-level tree below the chosen node. Suppose the node $i$ is connected to 4 nodes, each of which is connected to $1,2,4,3$ nodes respectively, and each of these nodes is also connected to more nodes (the exact number of connections is not important and the numbers here are merely illustrative, these links may contain cycles and thus include recursion). Assuming we have a representation for each of the 4 nodes connected to node $i$ already, then we can average these vectors, feed them into a neural network ${\\cal N}$ where the network generates a final output of embedding size $d$ as a node embedding for node $i$. Note that this approach from one hop away, can be recursively extended to the next 2 hops as well, ending with (in this case) 3 hops away (the leaves of the tree are the 3-hop nodes). At the last level, the inputs are the $k$-dimensional feature vectors for each node. These get transformed by weighting matrices in the vectors as we go up the tree to end up with the final embedding for node $i$. The node-level generated embeddings can be used with loss functions for similarity as discussed before in unsupervised mode, or on a node classification task in supervised mode. Once the neural net has been trained, you may generate embeddings for new nodes as they are added to the graph. This was not possible with the simpler embeddings discussed in the preceding paragraph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. So far, input vectors from the lower levels of a subtree emanating from a target node have been aggregated by weighted averaging of the inputs of neighbor nodes along with the embedding of the target node. Here, we use DGL, which implements a node embedding scheme known as [GraphSAGE](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/). This approach extends neighborhood aggregation to concatenating the target node embedding with a function of the neighborhood node embeddings that may be simply a mean (pooling), or other forms of pooling, as well as applying more complex activations such as LSTMs using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We will use these GCNs below. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. The embeddings and node features are now used to learn a classification neural net. \n",
